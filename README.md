## Conversion.html ##

This program is developed during my 2nd academic year 2019, just practicing further after the PCG.html made on my 1st year

 . Functionality:
converting input number/currency in real-time (offline mode)
JS Calculator 

 . Aim:
 JS practice
 Interactive and responsive GUI
 Calculator customized interface

 As same as the previous project, it is coded on android app
 #I didn't possess PC for VScode or any professional text editor at the time I was buiding it (Android 4.1 Jellybeans)
 taking me about 15 days to code and rectify.
 
This verion 1.0 is an updated of the program, using the same tehcnology as the previous one.
The upcoming version is still on hold, as this is the practice of my Grade 2

#Note that this program is just an idea coming out of my mind, not a professional one,
a kind of Test project
